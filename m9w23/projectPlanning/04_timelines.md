How do I estimate a Timeline for a Sprint? Project

Leave your judgement at the door, and begin tracking your time


As a user, I want to view my order
-> A day -> 1.5 days

Provide padding for your time frame 10%-20%

Always try to overestimate how much time it will take
Its better to overestimate and be on time, than it is to be late
