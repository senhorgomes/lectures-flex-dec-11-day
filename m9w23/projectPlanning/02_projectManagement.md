How are projects managed?

Traditional(Waterfall) vs Agile workflow

Waterfall - A specific deadline (Finals)

- Each piece is worked on one at a time to launch the project all at once V1 - V2
- Prone to roadblocks
- More solid intial planning
- Can be harder to split tasks

Client
- Create a government website
- This is going to take 1 year
- Cost - $100k

3 months into this and down 25k
Client reaches out and says you know what, can we add this feature?

-  Planning -> Database -> Backend -> Frontend -> Release

Pros?

Cons?
-   You can't change anything

Agile - Existing products/apps

- Iterative approach
- Dynamic
- Designed to deliver a product in smaller, faster stages / sprints V1 - V1.1 -V1.2 etc
- It is very Scrum compatible
- Individuals/interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Pros?

Cons?
-   Maintain consistancy
    -   More teams, more prone to "broken telephone"

React

- Login - Person A
    - Planning -> Database - NoSQL -> Backend -> Frontend -> Class components

- Main page - Person B
    - Planning -> Database - SQL -> Backend -> Frontend -> funtioncal components

How are props supposed to be named
-   Naming convention
- Separation of concerns

SCRUM -> Maintain consistancy with Agile project management

SCRUM leader -> Helps maintain consistancy amongst the team and project, track progress through each aspect

- Meetings that happen daily with your team
- What do we have to work on today?
- What progress have you made since yesterday?
- Do you need any help?
- Do you have any roadblocks?
