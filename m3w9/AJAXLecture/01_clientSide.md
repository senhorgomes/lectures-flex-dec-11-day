Client Side rendering vs Server Side rendering?
Projects that are CSR or SSR?
TinyApp -> Server Side Rendering

Tweeter?
In scripts, which are on the front-end
Client Side Rendering
Manipulate the frontend/DOM using javascript or jQuery

Benefits? Downsides?

Website like Facebook? Or Tiktok? Social Media Website with infinite scrolls

Doesnt look like we can do this in express

Server side rendering -> Its mostly beneficial for Multi Page Apps
TinyApp -> Login/Register/Update Url/New Url/Homepage

Reddit/Facebook -> Single Page
With client side rendering

A user goes to the page, Reddit gives them 15 posts to display on their page
Once they reach the bottom of the page, we're going to send more posts to display on their page

Content of the page is being modified
HTML -> Body
DOM -> Document Object Model
jQuery/Javascript
