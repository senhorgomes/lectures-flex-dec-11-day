Plan out our weather app

- NavBar we have different cities
- If a user selects a city, it should display the weather for that city and modify the title of the card
- Modifying not only the weather being displayed, but the selected city as well
    - Dynamic information

- APIs we need to fetch the information only once
- Once you click on a button, it should capture the city, and send an api request
- How do we trigger an api request?
    - Once when the user first loads the app - Default City
    - When a user clicks on a city - Selected City
